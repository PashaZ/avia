            <p>The synopsis of the Aviator slot machine is as follows: the user predicts to what height the plane will be able to take off before it loses control. When the airplane rises into the air, the multiplier of the playerâ€™s bet raises. Before the plane gets out of control, you can claim your winnings by pressing the corresponding button at any time.</p>
            <p>The playing area shows the runway of the airfield and the black sky above it. Below are two panels where you should bet. The left one indicates the size of the bet (it is set for the next round of the game), the right one indicates (optionally) the coefficient, upon reaching which the winnings are automatically withdrawn and credited to the player account.</p>
            <p>When the player places bets, the airplane takes off. As it gains height, the coefficient grows (at the start, it is equal to one, which means the player will simply receive his bet back). At some random moment, the airplane loses control and flies into the distance. The player must withdraw the winnings in time (manually or by setting the automatic withdrawal coefficient). If you do not press the withdraw button before the airplane flies away, the bet is lost and the round is considered lost.</p>

            <p>The bet multiplier at the start of each round is x1, it increases as the aircraft gains height.</p>
            <p>The RTP of the slot machine is 97%.</p>
            <p>The coefficient at which the aircraft loses control and the round ends is determined randomly before the start of the round. The RNG is responsible for determining this coefficient.</p>
            <p>It is possible to make 2 different bets on one round. You can set an autocashout for both of them.</p>
            <p>The rounds start automatically; there is a pause between them so that the players have time to place their bets.</p>

        <p>After launching the Aviator slot machine, the user needs to place a bet. Before the start of another round, the random number generator determines the coefficient at which this round will end (visually, this is displayed by an airplane flying off the screen). After the start of the round, the plane takes off and gains height, while the coefficient increases in parallel with its rise. At any time, the players can click the "Cash Out" button, and then their bets will be multiplied by the current coefficient and credited to their account. At a random moment (determined by the RNG), the aircraft gets out of control and flies away. If the player has not withdrawn the winnings before it, his bet is lost and the round ends.</p>
        <p>To place a bet, press the button "Bet". Optionally, you can make 2 parallel bets per one round. To do this, click on the button "Plus" on the bets panel in the upper right.</p>
        <p>To withdraw your winnings, you must click "Cash Out". If the player manages to do this before the aircraft flies away, he will receive the amount of his bet multiplied by the coefficient of cashout.</p>
