                <div class="text-tab-inn">
                    <p>With each loss, you need to double the bet. The bottom line is that players at the moment of winning will be able to compensate for all previous losses. It is important to understand that bettors should take into account their budget and have enough money to wait a long time for high coefficients.</p>
