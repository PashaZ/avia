                    <p>This is one of the most popular strategies for playing Aviator, which can be used not only for this game. It implies the following steps: if the player's previous bet has not played, his next bet must be doubled. The logic is that when the player still manages to win, he will make up for previous losses</p>

                    <p>Since the Aviator game lets the players win and does not allow for them  to remain without a win a long time, if the participant loses a certain amount, he is offered to receive a win in the near future.</p>

            <p>The Aviator game is running on a random number generator. This means that no one can predict the outcome of odds and interfere with the operation of the software, so it is impossible to find a 100% working tactic. Guests should understand that any strategy for playing Aviator allows you to minimize risks, correctly distribute the budget for bets and avoid typical problems of beginners.</p>
            <p>It is not recommended to use Aviator game strategies, which someone offers for money. You can often find offers of special tactics after paying to a card or electronic wallet. It is important to remember that most likely they are scammers and you should not trust them.</p>
