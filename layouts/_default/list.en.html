            <p>Players often try to minimize risks by developing numerous strategies and tactics for playing the Aviator game. Players use different Aviator strategies, which we will describe in the table below.</p>
            
            <div class="text-tab">
                
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h3>Martingale</h3>
                </div>
                
                <div class="text-tab-inn">
                    <p>With each loss, you need to double the bet. The bottom line is that players at the moment of winning will be able to compensate for all previous losses. It is important to understand that bettors should take into account their budget and have enough money to wait a long time for high coefficients.</p>
                </div>

                </div>
                
                <div class="text-tab-inn">
                    <p>Every 2 moves the player increases the bet if he wins or lowers it if he loses. The tactic is similar to Martingale tactic, and its essence lies in the fact that the game does not allow the player to lose for a long time and he will be able to take a sufficiently high coefficient finally.</p>
                </div>
